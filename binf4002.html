<h4><u>Pre-reqs:</u></h4>
<ul>
<li>Basic knowledge of probability, statistics, and linear algebra is expected and required.</li>
<li>Familiarity with programming with Python and versioning systems like Git is required.</li>

</ul>

<h4><u>Course Description:</u></h4>

Machine Learning (ML) has transformative potential for applications in health and medicine. You will learn fundamentals of machine learning, deep learning, and modeling clinical and biomedicine data using machine learning.<br>

<br>

<b>Objective:</b>
<br>
By the end of this course you will be able to:
<ul>

    <li>Learn foundations of major machine learning concepts and their relevance to health and biomedicine data</li>
    <!--li>Distill challenges in health and medicine data to technical challenges to address using ML</li-->
    <li>Develop new ML methods focused on health/biomedicine tasks</li>
    <li>Be better equipped to evaluate and validate of ML in healthcare and medicine</li>
</ul>

    
<h4><u>Course Material:</u></h4>
Course material will largely consist of lecture notes, and specific references provided for each module. No textbook is required, though some textbook chapters may be provided as additional reading.  <br><br>


<b>Policy on Generative AI:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Use of generative AI for understanding concepts and reading material is allowed.</li>
  <li><font color="red">We will not allow the use of generative AI for solving homeworks or doing machine learning modeling. Homework reports should not be generated using any AI tool. You will be given 0 points for the complete homework assignment if any violations are detected.</font></li>

   <h3>Format and Grading</h3>
    Lectures held twice a week (5 points for participation in-person)<br>
    <br>
    Homeworks:Problem Sets: Each homework will be a combination of numeric/conceptual/computational problem and data-driven/modeling questions (4 homeworks, 40 points). A 'Homework 0' will be assigned in the first week on basics of probability and linear algebra.

<a name="#Psets"></a>
<h3>Homework Assignments (40 points)</h3>
Homeworks will be assigned on Courseworks. Homeworks will be due 3 weeks after they are assigned. We have ensured ample time for all homeworks. However, we are allowing two slack days usable over the semester. If you are using a slack day for a homework, mention this on your homework submission (otherwise the TAs will assume late submission). You are free to use the slack days for any of the homeworks.<br>

<hr>

<a name="exams"></a>
<h3>Exams</h3>

There will be one mid-term (25 points) and one final exam (30 points). Both exams will be for the duration of the class. You will be allowed one Letter sized cheat sheet for formulae only. You will return the cheat sheet along with the exam for grading.

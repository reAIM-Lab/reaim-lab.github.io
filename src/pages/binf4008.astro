				<p class="mb-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">
					Machine Learning (ML) has transformative potential for applications in health and
					medicine. The complexity of healthcare and medicine has highlighted foundational
					challenges in ML such as lack of generalization, robustness, safety, inequity, and
					statistical interpretability. The generative AI revolution has brought quite a few AI
					applications to fruition, but many challenges still remain.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">
					The availability of large scale data and the foundation model paradigm brings in exciting
					opportunities for methodological progress in Machine Learning/Aritficial Intelligence,
					including generative AI motivated by health and medicine applications with applications
					that impact patients, clinicians, researchers, regularatory bodies, and data scientists
					developing such tools.
				</p>
				<p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
					In this course, you will learn about complexities that make health and medicine data
					unique and how it opens up opportunities for advanced AI. You will learn advanced ML/AI
					methods, for example, time-series modeling, (offline) reinforcement learning,
					probabilistic modeling, observational causal inference, and how foundation models are
					being used in medicine, and what challenges remain to be addressed, such as reasoning. The
					course will train students to map real-world challenges of working with health and medical
					data to statistical challenges that require new and advanced ML methods.

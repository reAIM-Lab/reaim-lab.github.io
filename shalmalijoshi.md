### About Me

I am an Assistant Professor at Columbia University, Department of Biomedical Informatics where I lead the reAIM lab. I am a member of the Data Science Institute, and affiliated with the SNF Center for Precision Psychiatry and Mental Health, and Computer Science. Before Columbia, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University and the Vector Institute. I completed my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. My vision is to design AI and ML systems to improve scientific inference and predictive capabilities in the biomedical sciences and informatics, focused on challenges of generalizability, reliability, and robustness. I develop methods that cut across deep learning, reinforcement learning, observational causal inference, and probabilistic modeling.

How to pronounce my name: Shaal--muh--lee.

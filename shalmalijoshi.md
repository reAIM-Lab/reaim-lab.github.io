## About Me
I am an Assistant Professor at Columbia University, Department of Biomedical Informatics where she leads the reAIM lab. I am a member of the Data Science Institute, SNF Center for Precision Psychiatry and Mental Health, and affiliated with Computer Science. Before Columbia, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University and the Vector Institute. I completed my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. My vision is to design reliable AI and ML systems  to improve clinical healthcare and inference capabilities in medicine research. I also focus on developing computational methods to quantify and mitigate algorithmic inequities using approaches that are more aligned with understanding broader health disparities. I develop methods that cut across deep learning, reinforcement learning, observational causal inference, and probabilistic modeling.  

How to pronounce my name: Shaal--muh--lee.

<h4><u>Pre-reqs:</u></h4>
<ul>
<li>Machine Learning (COMS W 4771-001) or equivalent (BINF G 4002) with grade B or higher</li>

<h4><u>Course Description:</u></h4>

Machine Learning (ML) has transformative potential for applications in health and medicine. The complexity of healthcare and medicine has highlighted foundational challenges in ML such as lack of generalization, robustness, safety, inequity, and statistical interpretability. Traditional ways of measuring the utility of ML models often do not reflect clinical/medical benefits resulting in technical innovations in ML methods.<br>

Exciting opportunities have opened up for methodological progress in Machine Learning motivated by health and medicine applications. The availability of large de-identified multi-institutional datasets for healthcare and medicine from around the world has accelerated progress in ML for health. These data are from healthcare providers and are patient-facing as opposed to traditional medical data, which is well-curated and collected for specific tasks. Patient-facing datasets are rife with some of the most complex statistical artifacts that require innovative ML solutions to improve over the state-of-the-art in health and medicine.<br>

In this course, you will learn about complexities that make health and medicine data unique and how it opens up opportunities for advanced AI. You will learn advanced Machine Learning methods useful in health and medicine applications, for example, time-series modeling, reinforcement learning, probabilistic modeling, causal inference, foundation models, unsupervised learning, and self-supervised learning. I will further provide an overview of challenges such as fairness, interpretability, generalization, robustness, safety, and policy implications of ML in health and medicine. The course will train students to map real-world challenges of working with health and medical data to statistical challenges that require new and advanced ML methods.<br>

<br>

<b>Objective:</b>
<br>
By the end of this course you will be able to:
<ul>

    <li>Get a foundational overview of state-of-the-art ML in healthcare</li>
    <li>Distill challenges in health and medicine data to technical challenges to address using ML</li>
    <li>Develop new ML methods focused on health/medicine tasks</li>
    <li>Better equipped to evaluate and validate of ML in health and medicine</li>
</ul>

<br>

   <h3>Format and Grading</h3>
    Lectures held once a week (5 points for participation in-person)<br>
    <br>
    Homeworks:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Problem Sets: Each homework is a mini-project divided into 3 problem-based questions (3 homeworks, 30 points)</li>
        <li>Reading assignments: Reading will be assigned prior to each lecture. Students will be expected to answer reflection questions associated with all reading assignments submitted prior to the lecture (15 points for completing reading assignments and corresponding questions).</li>
        <li>Final project - Each individual will propose and execute their own project. Project proposals due end of week 4, final projects in NeurIPS paper format (8 pages excluding references) due end of the semester (50 points).</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
Homeworks will be assigned on Courseworks. Homeworks will be due 3 weeks after they are assigned. We have ensured ample time for all homeworks.
However, we are allowing two slack days usable over the semester. If you are using a slack day for a homework, mention this on your homework submission (otherwise the TA will assume late submission).
You are free to use the slack days for any of the homeworks. No slack days for project submission is allowed (unless you have a medical emergency, in which case please contact the instructor).<br>

<h3>Projects</h3>

The goal of the projects is to identify a meaningful problem in health and medicine that can be addressed using Machine Learning. The project can be a new method, a new application, or a new dataset. Each type of project requires careful consideration of:
<ul>
    <li>What is the health or medicine problem?</li>
    <li>Why is it an important?</li>
    <li>What is the current state of the art?</li>
    <li>What is the gap in the current state of the art?</li>
    <li>Why is Machine Learning a good solution to address this gap?</li>
    <li>In what ways do you expect ML to address existing limitations?</li>
    <li>Are existing ML methods good enough to address your problem?</li>
    <li>If yes, what application-specific considerations are crucial for successfully addressing the problem?</li>
    <li>If no, what new methods are needed to address the problem?</li>
    <li>What is your methodological advancement to address this issue?</li>
    <li>What is a good evaluation of i) the validity of the method, ii) the relevance to the health/medicine problem, iii) utility to the applicaiton of interest</li>
    <li>What are the limitations of your method? What are the considerations before I can declare that my method is the best out there?</li>
    <li>What are the future directions that you think might improve on your proposal?</li>
</ul>

The project can be done individually or in groups of 2 students maximum. The project will be presented in class at the end of the semester. The project report will be in NeurIPS paper format (8 pages excluding references).<br>

    </ul>
    Instructor(s) will work with students to manage (temporary) data access to above data sources. Other data sources/tasks can be used in consultation with the instructor. Students will work closely with the instructor to scope the project and frequently update the instructor on progress on their projects at office hours. Please see the "Format and Grading" section for more details on the project.<br>

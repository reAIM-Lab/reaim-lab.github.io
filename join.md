Thank you for your interest in joining reAIM!

Dr. Joshi is an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI)](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/faculty/), an affiliate of the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/people/affiliates/), and a member of the [Data Science Institute (DSI)](https://datascience.columbia.edu/people/shalmali-joshi/). Consequently, there are several avenues for students and researchers to join our lab.

### Doctoral Students

Doctoral students can join our lab via the following programs:
- [Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/phd-in-biomedical-informatics/) located in the [Graduate School of Arts and Science](https://www.gsas.cuimc.columbia.edu/phd-programs) at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center.
- [Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/phd/) at the [Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.gradengineering.columbia.edu/academics/graduate/doctoral).

Given the individual nature of the PhD and our lab's focus on machine learning to a wide range of topics relevant to healthcare, thesis work will be driven by the student's research interests regardless of which program they join. The key difference is in core coursework and milestones: [DBMI students](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/courses/) will take classes on symbolic methods, clinical informatics, and healthcare delivery, while [Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/phd/requirements/) students will take courses in algorithms and systems. Students in both departments will take electives according to their research interests. While our offices are on the [medical center (CUIMC) campus](https://universitylife.columbia.edu/content/maps-locations), we will allocate desk space and resources at CUIMC regardless of which department the student joins.

When applying, please note your interest in working with Dr. Shalmali Joshi in your application.

### Postdoctoral Researchers

- Openings via DBMI will be posted on our website and the [DBMI Careers](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/dbmi-careers/) page.
- Postdoctoral researchers can also join DBMI via the Department's [National Library of Medicine (NLM) Training Grant](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/postdoctoral-fellowship-degree/) if they are U.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents. The NLM fellowship gives two years of support.
- The [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/research/postdoctoral-researchers/) has a postdoctoral fellows program. The fellowship does not have citizenship requirements and supports researchers for two years via year-long renewable appointments.

### Masters and Undergraduate Students

If you are a **current** masters or undergraduate student at Columbia University interested in rotating in our lab, please reach out to [Dr. Joshi]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact.html) with the following:

- Your program, major, expected year of graduation, and grades at any courses relevant to Machine Learning (e.g. Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Optimization, etc.).
- Your research interests and how they align with reAIM, goals for the rotation, and the amount of time you can commit to research.
- Contact information for references.
- Your unofficial Columbia and undergraduate (if applicable) transcripts.
- Title your email "\[reAIM\] Research Rotation Inquiry for Current Columbia {Undergraduate / Masters} Student"

### Visiting Researchers
